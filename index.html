<h3 class="titus"> Hair metal is a genre of metal that emerged in the 1970s and was at it's highest in the mid to late 1980s and even popular in the early 90s. They were mostly known for their mix of pop and hard rock and for their very over the top outfits with tight leather pants and long hair. Although the hair metal mania started to fade away with the rise of grunge metal, the bands that pioneered this genre still release albums and still remain relevant to this day. Some notable bands of this time were: Poison, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Guns N Roses, Whitesnake, Def Leppard and Van Halen. These were the kings of this genre. There are also some other bands like Warrant, Ratt and Cinderella that were not as huge as the other ones but still recieved a good amount of success because of their music.

<h3 class="fart"><br>Like I said before, grunge kinda took over the music world with bands like Nirvana but these bands still weren't done and released their own spin on grunge with albums like Crush, Slang, Dog Eat Dog, etc. and even in the late 90s and 2000s, these bands decided to go back to their roots with albums that resembled their previous successful albums with their iconic sound but with some modifications, with albums like Lost Highway, Euphoria, Have A Nice Day. These bands still release albums and keep selling out shows all around the world. Even thought these bands have gotten older, they still release albums like, Forever, This House Is Not For Sale, Diamond Star Halos. These bands will no doubt go down in history for changing the music world forever with their style of music and will not be forgotten.
